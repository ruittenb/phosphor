It has been twelve sectons since Baltar's surrender and our encounter with the advanced race, the mysterious ones who gave us coordinates which presumably would guide us to the planet Earth. No reference of time seems apparent in the curious directions so it's impossible to know whether we can expect to find Earth tomorrow or many yahrens from now. But our scouts have located increased signs of the trail taken by our ancestors, the thirteenth tribe. In my heart, I feel we are getting close. Celebrations are everywhere. Our people's expectations grow with every passing centar. We've given our weary combat pilots time for leisure and rejuvenation. Food, water and hope.
