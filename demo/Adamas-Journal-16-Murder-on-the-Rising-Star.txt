Our scouts have sent back word of yet another planet along the coordinates given us by our mysterious super race. More and more often, the planets we come across bear signs of the lost 13th tribe. We are getting closer to Earth. And once we have plotted her precise location, we will carefully formulate a plan for observing and sampling her culture. Too sudden an appearance from their relations in space could send our sister world into a wave of culture shock from which she might never recover. And are the inhabitants of Earth far in advance of us in their development or merely primitive animals fallen from a greater time? I feel we will soon know.
