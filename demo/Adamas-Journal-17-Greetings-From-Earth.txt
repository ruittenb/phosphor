By the good graces of the Lords of Kobol, the Galactica continues to lead her flock of survivors towards the coordinates given us by those great white lights that vanished as mysteriously as they first appeared.  There are those who speculate that those lights, advanced ships really, might have come from Earth, giving us great hope that they have a highly developed technology.  Even now, our long-range scouts patrol the quadrants, watching for signs that indicate that we are drawing close.
